           Bangladesh is a densely populated country in South Asia, characterized by its fertile delta formed by major rivers and a tropical monsoon climate. It is bordered by India and Myanmar, with a coastline along the Bay of Bengal. The capital and largest city is Dhaka, and its economy is significantly driven by garment exports. Historically a Muslim-majority country, Bangladesh is known for its rich culture, vibrant festivals, and role as the birthplace of modern microcredit. 
Geography and climate
Bangladesh's landscape is a low-lying, riverine delta, making it susceptible to flooding and cyclones.
The world's largest delta, the Ganges Delta, is located here, and the country's largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans, is shared with India.
It has a tropical monsoon climate with high temperatures, humidity, and heavy rainfall during monsoon season.
Cox's Bazar, on the southern coast, is the world's longest unbroken natural sandy sea beach. 
Demographics and culture
Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with a population of over 171 million people.
It is home to a predominantly Muslim population, with significant Hindu, Buddhist, and Christian minorities.
Festivals, both religious and secular, are an integral part of the culture and include major celebrations like Eid-ul-Fitr, Durga Puja, and the New Year's festival, Pohela Boishakh.
The country has six distinct seasons: Summer, Monsoon, Autumn, Late Autumn, Winter, and Spring.
